<h3>Education</h3>
    I am a second year game design major at Mountwest Community and Technical College.
<h3>Employment</h3>
    Previously employed at the Marshall university Rec Center as a lifeguard supervisor, I learned about and developed skills for leadership, cooperation/teamwork, and emergency resposes that help keep me calm under pressure.
  
<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<p> My main project currently is my dating sim "Blorbo From My Dating Sim", named after the 
    <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Blorbo_From_My_Shows">popular Blorbo tumblr meme</a>. 
    Although based on the Sun and Moon models from FNAF Security Breach and Help Wanted 2 VR, I took some creative liberties, 
    including simplifying and cartoon-ifying their designs.
    In game, Sun and Moon's faceplate is static and does not change to emote, 
    much like a mask. But in order to capture emotional expressions (emotes), 
    I decided to give them a more cartoonish expression logic to make a more clear emotional response to the player.

The design features a blue background, clouds and stars, with the SUPERSTAR DAYCARE logo in the center." style="width:55%" class="center">
<p> Further in development,
    I plan on designing a handful of different outfits for them to wear to add visual variety during the different dates.
    For Sun, I'd like pastel and kidcore aesthetics to shine through his clothing choices. For dates with Moon, I think a darker, soft goth or emo
    aesthetic would work nicely.

     <p>After completing my dating sim, I'd like to keep working on making games, ones that aren't fangames for FNAF. 
        I have one game in the design and planning stage that I'm working on with a handful of people.
    Inspired by the Malevolent Podcast (season 3, episodes 22-28), and the 2006 game Scratches,
we plan to make a point-and-click adventure game that follows the story of a detective, Levy, and the fraction of a god
in his head, Ryan. We're aiming for a thriller/psychological horror-puzzle-mystery feel, 
something to build suspense, force the player's detective skills into action, and keep everyone on their toes.
